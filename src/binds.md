# Shortcuts and Commands
On the previous page, we were greeted with the beauty of the TempleOS command line, so it's about time we put such a creation to good use; on this page you'll be able to explore commands within the compiler, and some handy shortcuts.

# Shortcuts
King Terry was kind enough to enlighten us all with native keybindings; each of which exist for a reason, so let's try and remember each one of them.
#### Essentials:
* \<SPACE>: acts as a keyboard alternative for the Left Mouse Button (LMB).
* \<ENTER>: similar to the aforementioned, this acts as an alternative to the Right Mouse Button (RMB).
* \<F1>: brings up the Help Menu.
* \<CTRL>+<M>: brings up your Personal Menu.
* \<ESC>: save & exit.
* \<SHIFT>+\<ESC>: abort & exit.
* \<WINKEY>: hold to show the drop down menu; use the arrow keys to cycle through.
* \<CTRL>+\<ALT>+\<T>: opens a new terminal.
* \<CTRL>+\<ALT>+\<N>: switches window.
